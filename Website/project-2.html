          <p class="first-p">The objective of this project is to provide you with an opportunity to explore and develop an Android application with a topic of your choosing through the many functionalities, design patterns, sensor interactions and hardware features on the Android Mobile Framework.</p>
          <p class="last-p">The topic and eventual outcome of the Android application should take advantage of the possibilities offered by a mobile device as an always present, always connected computing device that presents the user with a rich set of interactions using tools such as audio, video, GPS and other sensor functionalities. </p>

      <p>This project showcases my final project in designing and coding an Android application for actual use.
      The Interactive Newspaper is a light-weight newsreader that allows user to retrieve the latest news onto their phones. The application also includes a GPS tracking feature that detects the province that the user is currently in and automatically changes the news displayed accordingly.</p>

        <p>The first step I took in ideating and designing the Interactive Newspaper was to gather the necessary elements that were required for completion. Initially, as I did not have a clear goal for the application's purpose, all I considered was the GPS and light sensor capabilties found in most smartphones, the devices that I was developing my application for. After asking around in my peer group, I noticed that the amount of survival or outdoors-related applications were abundant, therefore I felt the need to develop something unique to stand out.</p><p> After careful consideration, I noticed that the newsreading applications that I use are often data and battery usage heavy. Through this, I decided that the application that I wanted to create was a light-weight newsreader that would help the user save on data and battery usage. Combining the newsreader topic with the GPS and light sensor functionalities, I noted down in my concept report that the application, the "Interactive Newspaper", is "an ever-changing newspaper application that regularly updates the screen with news around the location of the user."

        <p>After ideating and finally grasping my initial concept, I noted that I first needed to complete the newsreading and GPS functionalities. To complete the newsreading functionality, I took the CBC's RSS feed and took steps to parse and output the feed into my application. Afterwards, I placed the output into respective fields that contained the news title, a short description and the news link. For the GPS functionality, I took advantage of the Geocoder package to parse and convert longitude and latitude coordinates. This allowed my application to pinpoint the specific province that the user is located in and provide provincial news specific to the user's location.

      </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>The second step, after designing the main features and primary looks of the application, was to consider when and where users would most likely be using the app. After sorting through the few use-cases that I had thought of, my main goal was to then design the application to detect the light level of the environment using the phone's light sensor and deploy either the light or dark theme depending on the situation. By doing this, my goal was to allow users to always be able to use the application and to prevent damage to their eyes when viewing the application in low-light environments.</p>

        <video controls width="640" height="320">
          <source src="videos/bwa44-A1P2.webm" type="video/webm">
        </video>
      </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Lastly, the final outcome of the Interactive Newspaper put all of the functionalities together and thus allowed users to view local news specific to their current location, as well as world news and sports-related news around the country.</p>

        <video controls width="640" height="320">
          <source src="videos/bwa44-A1P2.webm" type="video/webm">

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>While the application was successful in reaching its objectives and providing a usable experience for the user, I felt that the application could definitely be improved further, both in the cosmetic appearance and the amount of functionalities that could be developed. Given more time, one of the biggest implementations that I would add would be a full in-app newsreader. As the application only allows for previews to be seen, a completely in-app reading environment would remove the disconnction between the switch from in-app preview to external internet browser for the full details of the selected news article.</p>
