          <p class="first-p">The objective of this project is to provide you with an opportunity to explore and develop an Android application with a topic of your choosing through the many functionalities, design patterns, sensor interactions and hardware features on the Android Mobile Framework.</p>
          <p class="last-p">The topic and eventual outcome of the Android application should take advantage of the possibilities offered by a mobile device as an always present, always connected computing device that presents the user with a rich set of interactions using tools such as audio, video, GPS and other sensor functionalities. </p>
          <h2 class="rquot">&#8221;</h2>

      <p>This project showcases my final project in designing and coding an Android application for actual use.
      The Interactive Newspaper is a light-weight newsreader that allows user to retrieve the latest news onto their phones. The application also includes a GPS tracking feature that detects the province that the user is currently in and automatically changes the news displayed accordingly.</p>

      </section>
      <section>
        <p>The first step I took in ideating and designing the Interactive Newspaper was to gather the necessary elements that I needed for the application. In my concept report, I noted the fact that the Interactive Newspaper is "an ever-changing newspaper application that regularly updates the screen with news around the location of the user." </p>
        <div class="project-1-video">
        <video controls width="640" height="320">
          <source src="videos/bwa44-A1P2.webm" type="video/webm">
        </video>
      </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>In order to do so, I needed implementation of GPS tracking as well as the ability to parse website information and output it into my application's text fields. To do so, I took the RSS feeds of CBC, converted the file's many tags into useful data, then applied it to the Interactive Newspaper.</p>
        <div class="project-1-video">
        <video controls width="640" height="320">
          <source src="videos/bwa44-A1P2.webm" type="video/webm">
        </video>
      </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>The second step, after designing the main features and primary looks of the application, was to consider when and where users would most likely be using the app. After sorting through the few use-cases that I had thought of, my main goal was to then design the application to detect the light level of the environment using the phone's light sensor and deploy either the light or dark theme depending on the situation. By doing this, my goal was to allow users to always be able to use the application and to prevent damage to their eyes when viewing the application in low-light environments.</p>
        <div class="project-1-video">
        <video controls width="640" height="320">
          <source src="videos/bwa44-A1P2.webm" type="video/webm">
        </video>
      </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Lastly, the final outcome of the Interactive Newspaper put both of these aspects together and thus allowed users to view news on a light-weight application that would change the news according to their geographical location.</p>
        <div class="project-1-video">
        <video controls width="640" height="320">
          <source src="videos/bwa44-A1P2.webm" type="video/webm">
        </video>
      </div>
      </section>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>The project, while successful in reaching its objectives and providing a usable experience for the user, I feel like the application could definitely be improved further. Given more time, one of the biggest implementations that I would add is a full in-app newsreader. As the application only allows for previews to be seen, a completely in-app reading environment would remove the disconnction between the switch from in-app preview to external internet browser for the full details.</p>
