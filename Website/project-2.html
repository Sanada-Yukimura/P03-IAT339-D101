          <p class="first-p">The goal of this final project is to create a video game of your choice, taking in themes and gameplay that you wish to create. While the topic and design of the video game is of your choosing, keep in mind that this project is a culmination of the concepts taught throughout the term and must contain the following aspects: A selection of the “Eight Types of Fun” by Hunicke et al., clear system design and win and loss conditions.</p>

      <p>Paradise Lost was my first complete adventure in programming a game that was more than just simple mouse clicks or keyboard presses. In Paradise Lost, I challenged myself to create a game that satisfied the Fantasy, Narrative and Challenge aspects of the “Eight Types of Fun”, as explained by Hunicke et al. Inspired by Dark Souls, which I was infatuated with at the time of developing Paradise Lost, I felt that the best way to create a game that infused all of these aspects was to develop a relatively vague story that would unfold as players completed the levels. </p>

        <p>The initial process consisted of three parts, brainstorming the concept and theme of the game, flesh out the four types of game design (System, Interaction, Motivation and Narrative) and how it affects my game, and finally note down the remaining aspects that I needed to make the game playable and fun for the player to enjoy.</p><p> After the initial brainstorming and gathering of details, the rest of the initial process was rather short. I definitely needed to create a storyboard that would solidify my ideas, as well as to construct a cohesive design report that would list and showcase the game that I would eventually be developing. The pictures below show the storyboard that contains my level and interaction design, as well as the UML that organized my code.

        <p>After ideating and finally grasping my initial concept, I noted that I first needed to complete the newsreading and GPS functionalities. To complete the newsreading functionality, I took the CBC's RSS feed and took steps to parse and output the feed into my application. Afterwards, I placed the output into respective fields that contained the news title, a short description and the news link. For the GPS functionality, I took advantage of the Geocoder package to parse and convert longitude and latitude coordinates. This allowed my application to pinpoint the specific province that the user is located in and provide provincial news specific to the user's location.

        <p>The second step, after designing the main features and primary looks of the application, was to consider when and where users would most likely be using the app. After sorting through the few use-cases that I had thought of, my main goal was to then design the application to detect the light level of the environment using the phone's light sensor and deploy either the light or dark theme depending on the situation. By doing this, my goal was to allow users to always be able to use the application and to prevent damage to their eyes when viewing the application in low-light environments.</p>

      </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Lastly, the final outcome of the Interactive Newspaper put all of the functionalities together and thus allowed users to view local news specific to their current location, as well as world news and sports-related news around the country.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>While the application was successful in reaching its objectives and providing a usable experience for the user, I felt that the application could definitely be improved further, both in the cosmetic appearance and the amount of functionalities that could be developed. Given more time, one of the biggest implementations that I would add would be a full in-app newsreader. As the application only allows for previews to be seen, a completely in-app reading environment would remove the disconnction between the switch from in-app preview to external internet browser for the full details of the selected news article.</p>
