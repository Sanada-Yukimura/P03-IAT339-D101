          <p class="first-p">The goal of this final project is to create a video game of your choice, taking in themes and gameplay that you wish to create. While the topic and design of the video game is of your choosing, keep in mind that this project is a culmination of the concepts taught throughout the term and must contain the following aspects: A selection of the “Eight Types of Fun” by Hunicke et al., clear system design and win and loss conditions.</p>

      <p>Paradise Lost was my first complete adventure in programming a game that was more than just simple mouse clicks or keyboard presses. In Paradise Lost, I challenged myself to create a game that satisfied the Fantasy, Narrative and Challenge aspects of the “Eight Types of Fun”, as explained by Hunicke et al. Inspired by Dark Souls, which I was infatuated with at the time of developing Paradise Lost, I felt that the best way to create a game that infused all of these aspects was to develop a relatively vague story that would unfold as players completed the levels. </p>

        <h3>Intial Preparation</h3>
        <p>The initial process consisted of three parts, brainstorming the concept and theme of the game, flesh out the four types of game design (System, Interaction, Motivation and Narrative) and how it affects my game, and finally note down the remaining aspects that I needed to make the game playable and fun for the player to enjoy.</p><p> After the initial brainstorming and gathering of details, the rest of the initial process was rather short. I definitely needed to create a storyboard that would solidify my ideas, as well as to construct a cohesive design report that would list and showcase the game that I would eventually be developing. The pictures below show the storyboard that contains my level and interaction design, as well as the UML that organized my code.

        <h3>Milestone 1</h3>
        <p>Milestone 1 of Paradise Lost was to create an interactable player character, objects for the player to interact with and the basic design of the first stage. First, I started with the player character. At this point, the player character was a simple cube with a sword that was also another rectangle. This was a placeholder as I had not yet finalized the design that I wanted to implement for my character sprite. Next, I implemented a simple box with two health for the player to use the sword to break, as well as a circular object that acted as a key that would unlock the next stage. I also added signs that would give the player a simple tutorial to help the user to understand the game mechanics. Lastly, the stage design was first created in Photoshop, where the background and layout of the stage was designed. Next, I implemented code that would prevent users from going beyond the walls of the stage, following the boundaries set by the background image.

        <h3>Milestone 2</h3>
        <p>Milestone 2 was split into two parts as I needed to develop two inner stages for the second level. As Paradise Lost is a puzzle game, I wanted to implement puzzle aspects such as a maze and a trivia section to the game. The maze section was the harder part as it was very difficult to implement code such that the user would bounce off of the walls correctly. While I was able to work out most of the bugs regarding the walls not interacting properly with the player character, there are some issues where the player would occasionally teleport forwards or backwards, resetting their progress. Overall, the maze worked well and, in a way, provided a challenge for the player. On the other hand, the trivia section was easier to develop. With only a simple true or false answer to the questions given, the player would be able to finish the level. At the time of developing this milestone, I only used placeholder questions as I would eventually give questions that were related to the lore of the game. By completing both wings of stage two, the two gates would open and thus allowing the player to complete the level. Milestone 2 was also the milestone in which I implemented the basic UI at the top of the screen. At this point, there were no elements design elements implemented, but the UI acted as a placeholder for Milestone 3.

        <h3>Milestone 3</h3>
        <p>The main goal in Milestone 3 was to create the final boss level as well as merge all of the levels together to create the final game. As Paradise Lost takes inspiration from games like Dark Souls where the bosses are unforgiving and cruel, I designed the boss stage to be rather hard to win. However, in reflection, I realize that the boss level was a bit too unforgiving and definitely would undermine most player’s progress and commitment into the game. Furthermore, while the boss level was designed to be quite easy if players were able to time their movements to the boss ability, it could definitely be a bit more intricate with regards to the boss’ behavior. After designing and implementing the boss level, the next step was to design and replace all the placeholder textures that were in place for testing. This included the player sprite, the key and box textures, as well as implementing the player health bar and any other miscellaneous textures. After this was complete, the final step was to link all of the stages together and create images for the story, which would create a connection for the whole game.
        Once everything was complete, a much-needed update to my initial UML was required. As such, I took all of the classes and functions and consolidated them into a <a href="UML_final.html">final UML document</a>.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>As Paradise Lost was my first foray into a more intricate game, I think that there were definitely aspects that I succeeded in completing while there were definitely aspects where I failed or needed more work in. Coupled with the time constraint of under a month to create this task, I feel that, given more time, I could definitely create a product that would be more fun to the player. First, with regards to the aspects that succeeded, I think the fact that I was able to create something that resembled a game in under a month would be considered a success of sorts. Additionally, as noted in my initial design report, I wanted to create a game that implemented the challenge, fantasy and narrative types of fun. While the challenge of the game itself could definitely be improved upon, I was able to create a fantasy setting with a story that explained the player character’s origin story throughout the game.
        </p>
        <p>With regards to the aspects that failed, I think the thing that upset me the most was that I was unable to create something more. Working on Milestone 3, I realized that the schedule I was following would not be able to finish the game in time for the deadline. In order to fix this, I needed to cut out content such as developing the boss behavior to be more intricate. Furthermore, I felt that the textures and art-style of my game could use more work, as the textures felt low-fidelity and amateur. Ultimately, excluding the issue of design direction and time constraints, I consider Paradise Lost to be a success.
