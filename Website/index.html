        <!-- First person bio or third person bio? -->
        Hello, my name is Benedict Wong. Iâ€™m a game designer and an object-oriented programmer.</p>
        <p>
        I am a game designer whose interests lie in creating and developing enjoyable experiences for the player. In order to do so, my goal is to develop games where players make meaningful decisions through various game mechanics such as the ability to make a clear choice.</p>
        <p>Through my amazing journey as a programmer, I've explored a variety of programming languages. However, while I have used general-purposed programming languages such as <strong>Python</strong> or <strong>C</strong>, I find myself most comfortable utilizing object-oriented languages such as <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Processing</strong>. These OOP languages help me to create programs that are intricate in both visual and mechanical aspects, something that I am unable do freely with Python or C. Through these OOP languages, I have worked on and created programs such as an interactive eco-system, side-scrolling games, and mobile applications.</p>
