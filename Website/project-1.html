          <p class="first-p"> In the series of milestones you will create a simulation of a natural world with animals (birds, fish, insects, mammals, etc) that move, eat, die and predators that hunt them. We will finish with simulating some flocking behavior and build some smartness into the simulation.  In the process you will learn Java and object oriented programming, and get plenty of practice opportunities.</p>
          <p class="last-p">Choose a kind of animal world you will build a simulation of. As we progress, you will have to draw your animals, their predators, their food, and features of the environment.</p>

      <p>The Interactive Eco-system was a project that helped introduce and develop my skills in using Java.
      The goal of this project was to develop a digital eco-system complete with animals and food, in which the animals would try to imitate real-world behaviors when approached with food and predators.</p>

      <section>
        <p>My first goal in developing this eco-system was to create a working prototype of fish swimming towards and consuming its food.</p>
        <div class="project-1-video">
        <video controls>
          <source src="videos/bwa44-A1P2.webm" type="video/webm">
        </video>
      </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Next, I added collision to the eco-system, forcing the fish to turn its trajectory if it was near a wall. At this point, I also took a step further, developing a health system that would deteriorate when the fish became hungry, slowing down their movement until they died. On the other hand, if the fish were constantly eating food, their health would increase and stay healthy, moving at their normal speed.</p>
        <div class="project-1-video">
        <video controls>
          <source src="videos/bwa44-A1P2.webm" type="video/webm">
        </video>
      </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Lastly, in the final milestone, I removed the statistics above the fish itself and implemented a GUI that allowed the user to view the statistics of each individual fish to determine whether the fish was healthy or not. Additionally, I also added in manual modification to the eco-system, allowing the user to control the ecosystem. Sounds were also added to provide a greater immersion to the eco-system which were also toggleable by the user if they found the sounds to be irritating.</p>
        <div class="project-1-video">
        <video controls>
          <source src="videos/bwa44-A1P2.webm" type="video/webm">
        </video>
      </div>
      </section>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Ultimately I think the project was a great success. The interactive ecosystem was able to emulate a fish tank with fish reaching for food in a semi-realistic manner. However, as I focused mainly on the code and much less on the design, I feel that the animal designs could definitely use some work. The animations could use a bit more depth, as simply waggling their tails made the fish feel very unrealistic and cartoonish.</p>
