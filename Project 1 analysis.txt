Project 1: Interactive Eco-system
Start-end date: September 2018 – December 2018
Programming Language used: Java

Introduction:
The Interactive Eco-system was a project that helped introduce and develop my skills in using Java. 
The goal of this project was to develop a digital eco-system complete with animals and food, in which the animals would try to imitate real-world behaviors when approached with food and predators. 
My first goal in developing this eco-system was to create a working prototype of fish swimming towards and consuming its food. 
Next, I added collision to the eco-system, forcing the fish to turn its trajectory if it was near a wall. At this point, I also took a step further, developing a health system that would deteriorate when the fish became hungry, slowing down their movement until they died. On the other hand, if the fish were constantly eating food, their health would increase and stay healthy, moving at their normal speed.
Furthering the project, at this milestone, my main development was creating predators that would see the normal fish as food, as well as allowing the user to see the statistics of the fish, noting their current health and their X/Y velocity.


Lastly, in the final milestone, I removed the statistics above the fish itself and implemented a GUI that allowed the user to view the statistics of each individual fish to determine whether the fish was healthy or not. Additionally, I also added in manual modification to the eco-system, allowing the user to control the ecosystem. Sounds were also added to provide a greater immersion to the eco-system which were also toggleable by the user if they found the sounds to be irritating.
